## About me
I'm Vincenzo Gargano i'm a student in Artificial Intelligence, self taught musician and artist.

In this website i'll write about music, art, science and all the stuff i'm intrested in and i think it's worth sharing. Trying maybe to connect them in some way.

## My Studies
I'm currently enrolled in AI master degree in **UniPi** (Pisa, Italy). I'm currently self studying **Computational Neuroscience** and **Dynamical and Complex Systems**. I'm intrested in connections between those two fields and *broadly speaking*: **Machine Learning**. During my master degree i've discovered about how much important is **Probability/Statistical learning theory** for AI methods so i'll focus on that too.

# My passions

I play guitar, i don't currently have particular project but i'm eager to start one. I'm intrested in **Jazz Fusion**, **Funk** and bubbly sounding things. I'm also intrested in **Electronic Music** and **Sound Design**, maybe in future i'll study something to start doing some production.

I'm really good at drawing from references. I'm intrested in **Digital Art** and restoring and coloring my favourite manga panels. Applying math to art is something i'm into too, creating shaders or art programming like live music coding. 

## My Socials
Here i'll post, music and art.
